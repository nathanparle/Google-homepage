# Google-homepage
Google homepage clone

This is a clone of the google homepage. This has taken around 10 days of on and off work. I have used codepen.io to view this once to check the code was correct, but since then have been just reopening the file using my browser. I haven't looked at or copied any of the code from google or any other source. There is no functionality on the website. Hoping that when I upload this to github, it will look the same.
